### CloudCannon: The Cloud CMS for Jekyll

[CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/) is cloud content management system and hosting provider for Jekyll websites. The way it works is this: 

1. A developer uploads a Jekyll site in the browser or syncs with GitHub, Bitbucket or Dropbox. 
2. CloudCannon builds the site, hosts it and
3. **provides an interface for non-technical people to update content**.

### Editors
 
* [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) is an editor-friendly interface over Git. This means that developers and editors can now use the same workflow and tool set.

### Themes

* With gem-based themes, some of the site’s directories (such as the `assets`, `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_sass` directories) are stored in the theme’s gem, hidden from your immediate view. Yet all of the necessary directories will be read and processed during Jekyll’s build process.
* You can run `bundle update <THEME>`, replacing `<THEME>` with the theme name, such as `minima`, to just update the theme gem:

  ```
  ~/.../sytws1920/apuntes(master)]$ bundle update jekyll-theme-midnight
