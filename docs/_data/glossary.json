    "Static server": "A static web server, or stack, consists of a computer (hardware) with an HTTP server (software). We call it **static** because the server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser",
    "Dynamic server": "A dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, most commonly an application server and a database. We call it **dynamic** because the application server updates the hosted files before sending content to your browser via the HTTP server"
